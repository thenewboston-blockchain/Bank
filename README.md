# Project Setup

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your environment. If you run into any problems, feel free to leave a 
GitHub Issue or reach out to any of our communities above.

## Local Development (Docker edition)

You need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

Copy `dotenv` to `.env` 

Open .env and edit settings

- `PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS` is an IP address of your docker host, this should be 10/8 or 172.16/12 or 192.168/16 ip address (ex. local net ip address)
- `ACCOUNT_NUMBER` use `TNB Account Manager` app to generate a new account for test purposes

Login to Github's registry 
```shell
docker login docker.pkg.github.com
```
Use your github's credentials or personal key if you have 2FA configured.

Run:
```shell
docker-compose up # add -d to detach from console
```

This will start a dev network to work with, network consists of Bank, PV, 2x CVs and all the needed services (celery, db, redis).

On a first run it will take some time to provision and configure test network settings.

If something failed, deleting `postgresql-data` and `redis-data` volumes might solve the issue (refer to `docker volume` cli), and try previous command again.

As a result
```
http://$PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS:8004 - BANK
http://$PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS:8001 - PV
http://$PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS:8002 - CV 1
http://$PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS:8003 - CV 2
```

You can add those to your TNB Account Manager app

### For Python developers (Docker edition)
To run all tests in parallel:
```shell
docker-compose run bank pytest -n auto
# or
docker-compose exec bank pytest # if docker-compose run is running
```

To monitor Celery tasks:
```shell
# For BANK
docker-compose exec celery_bank celery flower -A config.settings --address=127.0.0.1 --port=5555
# For PV
docker-compose exec celery_pv celery flower -A config.settings --address=127.0.0.1 --port=5555
# For CV n. 1
docker-compose exec celery_cv1 celery flower -A config.settings --address=127.0.0.1 --port=5555
# For CV n. 2
docker-compose exec celery_cv2 celery flower -A config.settings --address=127.0.0.1 --port=5555
```

## Windows (without docker)

This guide targets a unix environment however it is possible to perform this setup on Windows by installing Cygwin 
[here](https://cygwin.com/install.html).

When installing Cygwin ensure you add the following packages in the setup wizard choosing the most up-to-date version for each:

* python3
* python3-devel
* pip3
* gcc-core
* libffi-devel
* make
* python38-wheel
* libintl-devel
  
Once installed use Cygwin for all your command-line operations.

*This is because one of the dependencies, uWSGI, does not provide Windows support directly.*

## Steps (without docker)

Set required environment variables:
```
# Valid values are development, local, postgres_local, production, or staging
export DJANGO_APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT='local'

# 64 character signing key used to authenticate network requests
export NETWORK_SIGNING_KEY='6f812a35643b55a77f71c3b722504fbc5918e83ec72965f7fd33865ed0be8f81'

# A string with random chars
export SECRET_KEY='some random string'
```

Install Redis:
```
brew install redis
```

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.6 or higher.

Install required packages:
```
pip3 install -r requirements/local.txt
```

To initialize the project:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py initialize_test_bank -ip [IP ADDRESS]
```

## Local Development (without Docker)

Run Redis:
```
redis-server
```

Run Celery (run each as a separate process):
```
celery -A config.settings worker -l debug
```

To monitor Celery tasks:
```
celery flower -A config.settings --address=127.0.0.1 --port=5555
```

## Developers

To watch log files:
```shell
tail -f logs/warning.log -n 10
```

To run all tests in parallel:
```shell
pytest -n auto
```

When adding a package, add to `requirements/base.in` and then :
```shell
bash scripts/compile_requirements.sh
```

To generate documentation:
```shell
cd docs
make html
```
